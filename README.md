# Dashboard

Dashboard is a web-based application that provides a user-friendly interface for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database. It allows users to interact with their data easily and efficiently.

## Features
_Create:_ Users can create new records in the database by filling out a form with relevant information.
_Read:_ Users can view existing records in a tabular format, filter, and sort them based on specific criteria.
_Update:_ Users can edit and update the information of existing records directly from the dashboard.
_Delete:_ Users can delete unwanted records from the database using a simple interface.
